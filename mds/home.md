Hello and welcome to my website. I like to code, write about code and sometimes post it here for my own posterity. I also write about some of my hobbies and personal projects in the blog section. Mostly this webpage has been a playground for playing with different technologies like webpack, node and react. 

> I like to have fun, travel and push bits around. 

Living in Florida is great! The sun, sand and seasons are condusive to what my family loves to do. We go to the beach, vacation in the keys and travel when we want something different. As my kids get older I get to experience things with them again. Things that I loved to do when I was growing up in Florida. 

I'm not the best writer, so this place is not really for human consumption. It is really just a place where I can post useful bits of information. Maybe it will solve an issue for a random googler, which is an added bonus.
